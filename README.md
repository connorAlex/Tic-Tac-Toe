# Tic-Tac-Toe
A quick browser game to practice and internalize Object Oriented Programming within Javascript. Specifically focusing on the Module Pattern and Factory Functions.

## OOP
Throughout my history as a developer I've struggled with Object Oriented Programming and it's principles. Since games compliment OOP so nicely I utilized an opportunity to really cement myself within the content.

The JS is broken in to 4 objects:
1. game
2. displayController
3. gameboard
4. Player

The first three objects all follow the [Module Pattern](https://coryrylan.com/blog/javascript-module-pattern-basics), while Player is a [Factory Function](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#factorypatternjavascript)


## Styling
Since this project was to focus specifically on building out my confidence with OOP, there was a lesser emphasis placed on styling. However, I'm quite fond of the minimalist styling that I settled on.

I'm quite fond of the hover styling created by [transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) and [the box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), I think it gives it a nice modern sheen.
